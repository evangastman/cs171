1. Directories
-----------
The main directory is cs171-pr-heroin2012.
Subdirectories are:
- css
- data
- img
- js
- libs
- Project proposal

For the most part, these are self-explanatory.

The "img" directory contains the images used on our landing page.

The "js" directory contains the JavaScript files representing our individual views.

The "libs" directory contains the libraries we used for our project. They are as follows.

bootstrap
---------
We used this library to get nice CSS for buttons and stuff.

d3
--
This is d3! We use it throughout our project.

jQuery
------
We use jQUery for event handling.

Aside from these external libraries, the code in the project is our own. The overall structure
of the project was inspired by Homework 3.

4. Instructions
---------------
Our visualizations are intuitive and easy to navigate.
To get started, we recommend clicking a dollar bill stack to filter by income.
This will update the barchart on the right, and both charts below it interactively.
Then, choose sex or age filters, which will affect the mental health pie chart and
the crime chart interactively.
